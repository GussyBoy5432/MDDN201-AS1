# Example Template for SPA1
Wellington Connections
I've modified my website to my liking to where I've used a cool blue colour palette. I've collected a series of images and changed the grid to show the images in pairs. I like this grid as each image is catagorized under the main heading of where it was found and collected with the wellington cbd. I also designed a neat background on illustrator using plugs that connect and branch off around the template. I am really pleased with the outcome as it emphasises the imgaes in the foreground. I also added special borders around the images.
